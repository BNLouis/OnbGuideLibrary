# Introduction

Welcome to the OpenNetBattle engine.
This document will provide some beginner tutorials for content creation on ONB for all of the main types of mods.

## Mods

ONB currently has 4 types of mods.

- Players: These are the navi mods you play as. Their sprites are entirely customizable and you can even script your own moves.

- Cards: These are equivalent to battlechips and allow the user to perform actions.

- Blocks: These are "navicust" blocks used to give your navi buffs.

- Enemies: These are enemies and bosses that can be fought. There is a debug mode where these can be fought, and server creators can use these for encounters on their servers.
